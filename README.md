# Inventorian Upgrade Icons

This plugin displays the green upgrade icons on items in your bag, when using [Inventorian](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/inventorian).

**You don't need this if you have the [item levels](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/inventorian-itemlevels) plugin.**

Let me know if there are compatibility issues with other Inventorian plugins.

--------

**Important**: The addon does not manage item upgrades by itself, it only shows the icons if an other addon (like Pawn) marks the item as an upgrade
